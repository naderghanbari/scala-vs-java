This is an attempt to very introductory showcase of Scala as a JVM language and compare it to the mother of JVM 
languages, Java.

Check out [scala-vs-java](https://naderghanbari.github.io/scala-vs-java/). All the code used in the docs exist within
this repository, so feel free to checkout and get your hands on it. 

You will need SBT version 1.0 or higher and JDK 9 to compile/run the samples.
